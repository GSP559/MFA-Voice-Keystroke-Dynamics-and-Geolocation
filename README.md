# Multifactor Authentication System

## Project Overview
This project introduces an advanced **Multifactor Authentication System** that integrates **voice recognition**, **keystroke dynamics**, and **geolocation** for enhanced security. The system leverages feature extraction, machine learning, and geolocation verification to provide authentication.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), pitch, and tone analysis for precise user identification.
- **Keystroke Dynamics**: Measures typing speed and patterns using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between users.
- **Geolocation Verification**: Employs the Google Geolocation API to confirm the userâ€™s location within a predefined radius of their verified address.
- **Weighted Decision System**: Combines outputs from voice, typing, and location checks into a weighted decision score for authentication.

## Key Files
### 1. `Authentication.py`
Handles the user authentication process by:
- Loading pre-trained models for voice, typing, and location verification.
- Recording and analyzing user inputs.
- Computing a weighted decision score to authenticate users.

### 2. `Training.py`
Used to train models for:
- **Voice Authentication**: Records and extracts unique voice features.
- **Typing Patterns**: Collects typing speed data and trains an SVM model.
- **Geolocation**: Geocodes the verified user address for location verification.

### 3. `Utilities.py`
Includes utility functions for:
- Feature extraction (MFCC, pitch, and tone).
- Voice and typing data recording.
- Model saving and loading.
- Geolocation calculations and comparisons.

## Dependencies
- Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `librosa`
  - `sounddevice`
  - `soundfile`
  - `pickle`
- Google Geolocation API Key (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code).

## How to Run
1. **Setup**:
   - Install the required Python libraries.
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Google API Key in the code files.

2. **Training**:
   - Run `Training.py`.
   - Enter the required inputs (username, verified address, voice sample).
   - Models for voice, typing, and geolocation will be saved locally.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Run `Authentication.py`.
   - Enter the username for verification.
   - Provide real-time voice and typing inputs.
   - The system calculates a decision score to determine authentication success.

## Limitations
- High false positive rates for AI-generated voices.
- Geolocation accuracy depends on the user's network configuration.
- Limited testing dataset; system accuracy can improve with broader user data.
